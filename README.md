# Jenkins Bitbucket Pull Request Approval Plugin

This repository is a Jenkins plugin that interacts with the [Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-branch-source-plugin)
and provides the extended ability of only allowing pull requests that have an approval or a non-author approval before building.
